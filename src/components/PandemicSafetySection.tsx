        How We Have Been Empowering People to Work in the Pandemic?

        As social distance became the new normal and traveling became a concern
        for everyone, we tried to make journeys safer with 5 levels of safety.
        The first step was to sanitize the cab/car without leaving an inch. We
        check the health status of the driver multiple times in a day and anyone
        found unwell is given a leave till he is in sound health. To restrict
        the mutation of microbes, we only allow passengers who take all
        precautions while traveling like wearing a mask and sanitizing the
        hands. To protect each passenger, we even isolate the passenger from the
        driver with a protective sheet in the car.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base sm:text-lg mb-4">
        Moreover, we have integrated our services with technology and utilized
        tools like Arogya Setu to find out the probable health status of the
        passenger and encourage them to pay via online options to ensure
        contact-less drive.
